## Edugi (Epitech Innovative Project)

On this project, I am **Designer User Experience & User Interface**, responsible of the brand identity. I redacted the whole graphical chart of the brand.

## L'Atelier de Fred - 1st ver. (HUB Project)

In order to always improve and diversify my skills in Web Design and Web development, as well as to render service to *L'Atelier de Fred* by offering my services free of charge, I am transforming a previously created showcase website for this company.

The purpose is to improve the website in order to be able to perform purchases on it later.
